## LIDAR Processing

This repository contains scripts, notes, and metadata for LiDAR processing assignments and labs from Purdueâ€™s geospatial coursework. The project supports analysis of point clouds, classification accuracy, DSM generation, and surface modeling using tools such as MATLAB, ERDAS Imagine, CloudCompare, and ArcGIS/QGIS.
